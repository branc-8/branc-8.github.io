    <h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            EasyEDA is easy.
        </li>
        <li>
            However EasyEDA lacks some specific parts and breakouts. Had to use the chip itself for the MPU.
        </li>
        <li>
            This was an easy extension from the gyroscope project.
        </li>
        <li>
            You have to right click to make lines stop in EasyEDA.
        </li>
