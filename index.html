    <tr><td><h2>1.) Design and complete robotic and embedded systems solutions that apply to real-world situations and challenges.</h2></td></tr>
    <tr><td><p><h1>Drum machine</h1>
        A simple "drum machine" musical instrument that steps through an array of pitches to create a beat. This design utilizes a speaker, buttons and an arduino.

    <tr><td><p><h1>Green Houseparty</h1>
    My Student Innovation Project which would read soil levels and water a plant while singing to it. This design utilizes an ESP32, a soil moisture sensor and a speaker. It contains bytecode which plays the audio sample.
