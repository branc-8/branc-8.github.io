        Thank you for your interestin a Flying Cheese Wheel drone. Its unique design makes it a desireable purchase.<br /> 
        Features include:
        <ul>
            <li>4 High Speed Brushless Motors</li>
            <li>Wi Fi Controls over Websockets</li>
            <li>Auto Leveling</li>
            <li>PLA and Wood Construction</li>
            <li>UMC 6050 Gyro</li>
            <li>ESP 32 Wroom 32 Flight Controller</li>
            <li>Battery</li>
            <li>API Expandable to IOT</li>
            <li>Unique Design</li>
            <li>Roomy Interior Leaves Room for Future Add Ons, Such As GPS or A Claw</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Lessons Learned from Development:
        <ul>
            <li>Making a drone from scratch is a very involved process.</li>
            <li>ESP 32-Only drone is very doable, but developing a drone from code made for another microcontroller is tough.</li>
            <li>Making something controlled via JSON messages over websockets can be very difficult if you do not know what you are doing.</li>
            <li>Even the basic control scheme was tough to explain to classmates that have no experience in this.</li>
            <li>PID controllers are a subset of control theory, which is a subset of differential equations.</li>
            <li>ESP32s have something called SPIFFS which allows you to have a filesystem on the device, which is probably why it looks like an FTP server.</li>
            <li>Trying to do CAD work in Blender takes A LOT of practice, even if it is a useful skill to understand precision modeling in Blender.</li>
            <li>I still have a bad habbit of wanting to do everything the hard way.</li>
            <li>Wifi drone controls opens up all sorts of interesting possibilities</li>
            <li>Hobbyists tend to do this kind of thing with this kind of controller with LoRa instead of WiFi</li>
            <li>There is a wealth of knowledge to be had in trying to develop a drone. I A LOT about the ESP32.</li>
            <li>I am probably going to continue to work on this project because building a drone from scratch is actully pretty cool.</li>
        </ul>
