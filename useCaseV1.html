<h1>Use Cases</h1>
<h2>Use case 1:</h2>
<p>Hovering: Drones can hover! Isn't that neat? Quadcopters can typically spin their propellers at a somewhat even pace and use a gyro to adjust for unbalances, allowing them to hover.</p>
<h2>Use case 2:</h2>
<p>Move: Quadcopter drones can typically fly in different directions based on user input, usually bieng faster or slower and if they are more sophsticated they can keep stable for reasonable distances.</p>
<h2>Special use case:</h2>
<p>Gacha machine: A special use case for the drones is a gacha machine/claw machine/UFO Catcher. The idea is that you can have a bunch of items in an area and use the drone to try to pick them up into a box, and if you put it in the box you "win" the item, just like a claw machine in an amusement center. You could have a claw attatchment that closes and use the drone as a mechanism to go higher or lower.</p>
